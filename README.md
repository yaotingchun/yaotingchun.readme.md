|<p align="center">1</p>| [Poster (Industry Talk: Overview of ICT Jobs)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TnQoQpAkC85EtYGZ-TVlFK-ki6_priwh/view?usp=sharing)|  23 NOV 2024  | <p align="justify">Throughout the talk given by Clarity Techwork, I am introduced with different job roles in a tech company such as  UI/UX Developer, QA Testing Analysis and Web Developer. The seamless integration of each department allows the project to be done with ease. Besides, the talk also emphasizes on technical skills and soft skills that I need to develop to remain competitive in the market. Additionally, I found out that I also must actively explore the latest technology worldwide, as ICT field evolves rapidly. Moreover, I also able to master the features of Canva in this project.</p>|
|<p align="center">2</p>| [Video (Industry Visit: UTM Digital)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1svd3S-d1m-s2f7pQUQaddCeglenBGc_C/view?usp=sharing)|  10 DEC 2024  | <p align="justify">Throughout the visit to UTM Digital, I am able to visualize how an organization actually operate to produce desired outcome for customers. This is a great addition to my experience because I can gain exposure on the real working environment, which helps me to adapt to work life in future. Furthermore, I also can see how each departments work together and the work flow to achieve a successful project. Other than that, this project enables me to learn the very basic video editing skills, which could potentially benefits me in future. </p>|
|<p align="center">3</p>| [Report (Industry Talk: Skills in University & Industry)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pSHC18H6se66jZ3MXhh7PSo9mBcTIH3Y/view?usp=sharing)|  17 DEC 2024  | <p align="justify">Throughout the talk, I found out that I am still lacking a lot of essential skills that are needed in ICT jobs. This talk motivates me to start sharpening the skills that I already mastered and start exploring the new skills that I haven't mastered yet. Besides, this talk also emphasizes on job application process, which I found very useful as guide for me to apply jobs in future. Other than that, the speaker also motivates us to have our own tech startup and teach us how to turn your business idea into reality. In addition, I also learn how to write a report in an academic style, which is crucial in my thesis writing later on. </p>  |

PowerBI is such a powerful tool to visualize all the raw data into informative insights to help with decision making. As a data engineering students, it is a great opportunity to attend a workshop like this as it can be used as my extra skillset in my future workplace. Additionally, it helps to sharpen my designing skills by exploring more useful features in Canva. </p>|
|<p align="center">5</p>| [Design Thinking Project (HashRemote)](https://youtu.be/SMFT7hZgijk)|  17 JAN 2025  | <p align="justify">Throughout this project, I am able to enhance my understanding on Internet of Things by applying its theory into actual solution, which is HashRemote. Besides, as I took part in designing the application prototype, I am also able to explore some of the UI/UX design knowledge. Last but not least, I now understood the flow of design thinking and how to implement it with the process like empathize, define, ideate, prototyping and testing phase.  </p> |
